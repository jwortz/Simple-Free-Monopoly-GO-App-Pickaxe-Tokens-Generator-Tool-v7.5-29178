Players will use these tokens to dig through 20 levels in the mini-game. Completing all levels will reward you with plenty of dice rolls, the new Crystal Crest Shield, the Twinkle Tail Token, and a Five-Star Sticker Pack. In this guide, weâ€™ll show you how to get free Pickaxe Tokens for Crystal Treasures in Monopoly GO.

An easy way to get free Pickaxes for Crystal Treasures is by completing Quick Wins tasks. You get three daily tasks in the Quick Wins section in Monopoly GO. You can finish them by doing simple things like rolling the dice, upgrading landmarks, or landing on certain tiles. Once you complete them, new tasks will be available the next day, and players can complete them to earn more tokens.

Monopoly GO keeps introducing solo events and tournaments that offer lots of valuable rewards. Right now, the Cavern Quest solo event is live. This event runs for two days from October 2 to October 4.

You can also get more Pickaxe Tokens by grabbing them from the Free Gift section in the game shop. The gift refreshes every eight hours, so players will be able to collect tokens multiple times a day.
